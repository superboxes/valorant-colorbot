# Valorant Colorbot

This is a valorant colorbot (triggerbot) that has been sitting on my pc for a while, so i decided to post it. While it's mostly undetected, you should still be careful with it and dont use on mains.

## Features

- Easy to compile and run
- Some customization
- Mostly undetected

## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the Valorant Colorbot:

1. **Download the Source Code**: The first step is to download the source code from this repository.

2. **Compile the Source Code**: Use a compiler such as PyInstaller or Nuitka to compile the source code into an executable file.

3. **Encode the Executable (Optional)**: While this step is not required, it's recommended for additional security. You can use an encoder like Themida for this purpose (which I use).

4. **Customize the Configuration**: Before running the executable, make sure to customize the configuration according to your needs.

5. **Run the Executable**: Once the configuration is set, run the executable file.

6. **Start Valorant**: Launch Valorant.

7. **Play the Game**: Now you can play the game with the colorbot running in the background.
