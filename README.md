# Valorant Colorbot

This is a valorant colorbot (triggerbot) that has been sitting on my pc for a while, so i decided to post it. While it's mostly undetected, you should still be careful with it and dont use on mains. Has 2 different ways of shooting: one with an Arduino Leonardo mouse library and another with the Python Keyboard library. The first one is more secure, but the second one is easier to use and doesnt require any extra hardware.

## Features

- Choice between 2 different ways of shooting (Arduino Leo or Python Keyboard)
- Easy to compile and run
- Some customization
- Mostly undetected

## How to Use (Python Keyboard)

Follow these steps to use the Valorant Colorbot:

1. **Download the Source Code**: The first step is to download the source code from this repository.

2. **Compile the Source Code**: Use a compiler such as PyInstaller or Nuitka to compile the source code into an executable file.

3. **Encode the Executable (Optional)**: While this step is not required, it's recommended for additional security. You can use an encoder like Themida for this purpose (which I use).

4. **Customize the Configuration**: Before running the executable, make sure to customize the configuration according to your needs.

5. **Run the Executable**: Once the configuration is set, run the executable file.

6. **Start Valorant**: Launch Valorant.

7. **Play the Game**: Now you can play the game with the colorbot running in the background.

## How to Use (Arduino Leonardo)

Follow these steps to use the Valorant Colorbot:

1. **Download the Source Code**: The first step is to download the source code from this repository.

2. **Customize the Configuration**: Before flashing the script onto the Arduino Leonardo, customize the inside of the script according to your needs (if you need).

3. **Flash the Arduino Leonardo**: Use the Arduino IDE to flash the Arduino sketch onto the Arduino Leonardo.

4. **Change the configuration**: Change the configuration in config.json to match the port and the baudrate of the Arduino Leonardo.

5. **Compile the Source Code**: Use a compiler such as PyInstaller or Nuitka to compile the source code into an executable file.

6. **Encode the Executable (Optional)**: While this step is not required, it's recommended for additional security. You can use an encoder like Themida for this purpose (which I use).

7. **Run the Executable**: Once the configuration is set, run the executable file.

8. **Start Valorant**: Launch Valorant.

9. **Play the Game**: Now you can play the game with the colorbot running in the background.
